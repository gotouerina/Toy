# Batch-Builder
A  script to build batch for ParaFly

#   已是废案，仅供复习语法

Considering an example for only one variable:

    faSize *.fa -detailed > *.sizes

You can understand that this commond line can usually be splited into these parts

    constant1 variable.suffix1 constant2 > variable.suffix2

And for this example constant1 = faSize, suffix1 = fa constant2 = -detailed suffix2 = sizes ,and the variables are setted in a batch_file

Not surprisingly，the constant can be blank by enter a space. Your can do [sh batch_standard.sh] to build the batch

Also,considering the follow situation

    samtools faidx *.fa

These commond line can be splited in follow parts:

    constant1 variable.suffix constant2

constant1 = samtools faudx suffix =  fa constant2 = blank

You can do [sh batch_noneout.sh] to build this type of batch

If you want to run the batch_run.sh by one step,Please Uncomment the the last two lines.Before this, you should make sure you install the ParaFly software.
  
  
If not ,you can type 

    conda install ParaFly

The python scripts can be used for anthor use,for example the tsv.sh for data download.

The example file contains an example tsv file download from ENA(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home),  PRJNA842889


I also provide a C version in src for only download data.

Type:

    git clone https://github.com/gotouerina/Batch-Builder.git && cd Batch-Builder/src && make

to get the executable file
